Akka/Spray Implementation for theRESTbakeOff[tm]

To build and run this project you need sbt 0.12.x:

% sbt
...
> update
...
> container:start

The WAR can also be deployed to any container that supports the
Servlet 3.0 spec; at the moment this is how asynchronous request
processing is supported.

The current implementation uses:
 - Backends with various actor implementations to act as key-value stores.
 - Spray Routing to dispatch HTTP requests to the appropriate storage backend.
 - Akka for actor support.

We currently have the following backends:
 - Memory-based hash map. (Single-actor.)
 - Filesystem (with multi-directory sharding). (Actor-per-request.)
 - MongoDB. (Actor-per-request.)

The backends can be configured by editing application.conf.
