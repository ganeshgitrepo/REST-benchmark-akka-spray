Akka/Spray Implementation for theRESTbakeOff[tm]

To build and run this project you need sbt 0.10.1:

% sbt
...
> update
...
> jetty-run

The WAR can also be deployed to any container that supports the
Servlet 3.0 spec; at the moment this is how asynchronous request
processing is supported.

The initial implementation uses an in-memory hash table, just like
the reference implementation.
