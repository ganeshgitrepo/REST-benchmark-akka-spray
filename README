Akka/Spray Implementation for theRESTbakeOff[tm]

To build and run this project you need sbt 0.11.x:

% sbt
...
> update
...
> container:start

The WAR can also be deployed to any container that supports the
Servlet 3.0 spec; at the moment this is how asynchronous request
processing is supported.

The current implementation uses:
 - Akka Mist for dispatching HTTP requests along a service bus;
 - Spray for picking up requests from the service bus and dispatching to a backend;
 - Backends with various actor implementations to fulfill the put/get requests.

We currently have the following backends:
 - Memory-based hash map. (Single-actor.)
 - Filesystem sharding. (Actor-per-request.)
 - MongoDB. (Actor-per-request.)

The backends can be configured by editing akka.conf.
